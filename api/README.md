# Library Management System

A comprehensive library management software built with Node.js, Express, and SQL Server. This system provides a RESTful API for managing library operations including user management, book cataloging, borrowing records, categories, and comments.

## Features

- **User Management**: Handle library members and administrators
- **Book Cataloging**: Manage library book inventory
- **Borrowing System**: Track book loans and returns
- **Categories**: Organize books by categories
- **Comments**: Allow users to comment on books
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication for secure access
- **RESTful API**: Clean and structured API endpoints
- **SQL Server Integration**: Robust database backend

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: SQL Server (MSSQL)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Package Manager**: pnpm
- **Development Tool**: tsx for hot reload
- **Authentication**: JWT (jsonwebtoken) with bcrypt for password hashing

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- SQL Server
- pnpm

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd library-management-system
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
    ```
    SQL_SERVER=your-sql-server-host
    SQL_DB=your-database-name
    SQL_USER=your-username
    SQL_PWD=your-password
    SQL_PORT=your-sql-server-port
    JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret-key
    ```

4. Set up the database:
   Run the SQL script located at `src/config/librarymangement.sql` to create the necessary tables and schema.

## Usage

### Development

Run the development server with hot reload:
```bash
pnpm run dev
```

### Production

Build and start the production server:
```bash
pnpm run build
pnpm run start
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:3000`

## Authentication

The API uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication. Include the token in the Authorization header as a Bearer token for protected routes.

### Login

To authenticate, send a POST request to `/api/users/login` with user credentials. The response will include a JWT token that should be used for subsequent requests.
